WarDragons (an iOS game developed by PocketGames) has at least 71 breedable dragons which interact with one another in many different ways.  By analysis of the csv files located within the app, I have discovered the logic used to determine 
what breeding combinations produce which output dragons at what odds.  There are 1944 valid pairings of these dragons - too many to easily interpret.  This shiny application enables you to make practical decisions based on your available options without spending time sifting through all 1944 pairings.

The app is currently hosted at wardbreeding.ddns.net
The "introduction" tab outlines how to utilize the decision-making functionality.
