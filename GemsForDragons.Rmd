An analysis of gem spending in WD.
Assume your goal is to get powerful dragons, because come on that's the point of the game, right?

Speeding up egg missions:
```{r}
timedata<-c(900,840,3000,2940,20280,20220,2760,1320,2700,1200,19980,1050,19860,2520,1020,2448,2330,840,19620,760,19500,730,2190,19440,2080,600,480,1940,280,1800,19080,240,19020,1670,180,105,58,1550,18780,1450,1310,18600,18480,1160,18180,850,6000) 
costdata<-c(15,14,25,24,143,142,23,13,22,12,141,11,140,21,10,20,19,9,139,8,138,7,18,137,17,6,5,16,4,15,136,3,135,14,2,1,0,13,134,12,11,133,132,10,130,7,56)
#baseline for fresh: 
#1h=30 4h=92
#4h is worth 80 while 1h is worth 20

```
The cost to speed up these missions appears to be linear and vary across mission type in a way that makes it more expensive to speed up higher missions:  
Therefore, the 20-token 1hour missions are probably the most bang/buck (assuming you don't mind actually doing them).  
You get 
The direct purchase of egg tokens is 34/200 apparently.

...math about the cost of a darja, math about the cost of a bred dragon.

How does this compare to buying a carsis/darja?
```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
