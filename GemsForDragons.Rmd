An analysis of gem spending in WD.
Assume your goal is to get powerful dragons, because come on that's the point of the game, right?

Speeding up egg missions:
```{r}
#baseline for fresh: 
#1h=30 4h=92
basictime<-c(3600)
basiccost<-c(30)
midcost<-c(92,65)
midtime<-c(14400,9240)
expcost<-c(7,6)
exptime<-c(600,480)
#4h is worth 80 while 1h is worth 20

```
The cost to speed up these missions appears to be semi-linear and varies across mission type in a way that makes it more expensive to speed up higher missions:  
Therefore, the 20-token 1hour missions are probably the most bang/buck (assuming you don't mind actually doing them).  
You get 40 tokens for 30 gems.

The direct purchase of egg tokens is 34/200 apparently, so don't do that!

...math about the cost of a darja, math about the cost of a bred dragon.

How does this compare to buying a carsis/darja?
```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```
