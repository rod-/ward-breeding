## * Check your completed colors:

This is telling you to tick the dragon colors that you have full sets of - so if you own all the red and purple dragons, then tick "red" and "purple".
Note that purchased dragons (Fenrir, dominus, numen, etc) do not breed, so they do not count towards the full set.

## * Choose partial colors:

Click this box and choose the colors you don't currently own a complete set of - but have one or more dragons in

## * Dragons in Partial Colors

Click this box for a drop list of dragons - add into the field all dragons you own in incomplete colors.  
Dragons which are not currently breedable should still be added into the list.

## * Search

Take a look at the result table.  By default, the best 5 options are displayed.  You can change this number if you wish to look at different choices.

### *   FirstDragon x SecondDragon
These are the two dragons that you would choose to breed.

### *   First/Second/Third/Fourth/Fifth/Sixth
These are the egg fragments that the breeding pair can give, in decreasing order of likelihood.  First is the most likely outcome.

### *   ChanceofNewEgg
This is the likelihood of rolling a fragment that you do not currently own*.

## * Example:
If i own all red, purple, and blue dragons, the first breeding pair listed is
Etzel x Kobahl
This breeding pair produces volos, ankor, and lucius, three orange dragons.  25.64%* of the time, one of these three will come up - a new fragment.
