Wiki page for progressing in minimal time:


How to progress quickly without spending much time:

*Get Elite.  Two queues is much much better than one.  Our event rewards justify this expense - events will be run every month!
*Keep your build queues running as much as possible.  If you're going to work for 8 hours and will log in when you get home, make sure your queues will take ~8 hours to finish!
    **Ask for help if you need it.  There's a lot of wood.
    **Use speed-ups carefully to manage the timers.  If you are going to a 6-hour block of classes in 20 minutes, and your build queue finishes in 60 minutes, 45 minutes worth of speed-ups can save you 7 hours on your timers!
*Breed wisely
    **If you need help, ask.  There are resources available.
    **Complete your breeder quest(s) when you get the chance, those tokens add up.
*Push off your resources to online teammates when you're going offline.  They're going to get stolen otherwise.
*Make use of your 5 daily dragon exp boosts.
    **When you have time for several attacks, raid enemy bases with help from higher-leveled players.  If you only use 1 dragon per fight, you get 100% exp multiplied by the 5x and can repeat once for every dragon.  If you use 3 dragons per fight, you get 33% exp multiplied by 5x AND you use 3 of your dragons' multipliers.
